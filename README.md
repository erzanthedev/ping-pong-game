# 🕹️ Pong Game Project 🕹️

Welcome to my Pong Game project! Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game simulates table tennis, where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

In this project, I started with full HTML for the structure, full CSS for styling, and almost all JavaScript for functionality. This approach allowed me to focus on understanding the logic behind using the HTML Canvas element along with the `requestAnimationFrame` method, which enables smooth animations using JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project was to learn how to implement a classic Pong game using the Canvas element and `requestAnimationFrame`. Additionally, I aimed to understand how developers can efficiently and effectively solve problems by leveraging existing codebases and libraries. By doing this, I could focus on building the Pong game without reinventing the wheel.

## 📚 What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to implement the following:

- **Setup Canvas**: Initialize the Canvas element and set up the drawing context.
- **Game Logic**: Implement the core mechanics of the Pong game, including paddle movement, ball movement, and collision detection.
- **Animation**: Use `requestAnimationFrame` to create smooth animations for the game.
- **Game Controls**: Handle user inputs to control the paddles.
- **Modular Code**: Utilize existing codebases and libraries to enhance the development process.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Canvas Element**: Utilized the HTML Canvas element to render the game graphics.
- **Smooth Animations**: Implemented smooth animations using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enabled user interaction to control the paddles and play the game.
- **Efficient Development**: Leveraged existing codebases and libraries to build the game efficiently.
